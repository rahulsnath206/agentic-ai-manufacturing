\# üöÄ How to Run and Demo Your Agentic AI Project



\## Quick Start Guide



\### 1. Setup (5 minutes)

```bash

\# Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt



\# Verify installation

python test\_system.py

```



\### 2. Run the Streamlit GUI (Recommended for Demo)

```bash

streamlit run streamlit\_app.py

```

\*\*This opens a professional web interface at http://localhost:8501\*\*



\### 3. Alternative: Use Jupyter Notebook

```bash

jupyter notebook agentic-ai-prototype.ipynb

```



\## üéØ Demo Flow for Interview



\### Step 1: Explain the Problem (2 minutes)

"Manufacturing companies have data silos - production systems and quality systems don't talk to each other. This creates blind spots in quality control and makes it hard to trace defects back to their root causes."



\### Step 2: Show the AI Solution (3 minutes)

1\. \*\*Load the Streamlit app\*\*

2\. \*\*Click "Load Sample Data"\*\* - Explain you're loading 5,000 production records and 5,000 quality measurements

3\. \*\*Click "Run AI Schema Mapping"\*\* - Explain how the AI uses semantic similarity to find relationships between datasets

4\. \*\*Show the discovered mappings\*\* - Point out that `part\_id` maps to `component\_id`, etc.



\### Step 3: Demonstrate Integration (2 minutes)  

1\. \*\*Click "Create Unified Dataset"\*\* - Show how 10,000 separate records become 5,000 integrated records

2\. \*\*Explain the integration success rate\*\* - 100% integration shows the AI correctly found the relationships



\### Step 4: Show Business Value (3 minutes)

1\. \*\*Point out the quality dashboard\*\* - 83.4% pass rate, identify worst performing machines

2\. \*\*Show defect traceability\*\* - Can now link failed parts back to specific production lots and machines

3\. \*\*Highlight anomaly detection\*\* - AI automatically finds outliers that need investigation



\### Step 5: Export and Next Steps (1 minute)

1\. \*\*Download unified dataset\*\* - Show how this creates actionable data for manufacturing teams

2\. \*\*Explain scalability\*\* - This approach works with any manufacturing data, not just these specific formats



\## üó£Ô∏è Key Points to Emphasize



\### Technical Excellence

\- \*\*"This is true Agentic AI"\*\* - The system makes autonomous decisions about data relationships

\- \*\*"Semantic similarity algorithm"\*\* - Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity, same principles as modern LLMs

\- \*\*"Scalable architecture"\*\* - Modular design can handle new data sources automatically

\- \*\*"Production-ready code"\*\* - Error handling, logging, professional GUI



\### Business Impact

\- \*\*"Reduces integration time from days to minutes"\*\* - No more manual data correlation

\- \*\*"Enables real-time quality control"\*\* - Immediate defect traceability  

\- \*\*"Data-driven manufacturing decisions"\*\* - Stop guessing, start optimizing

\- \*\*"Cost savings through automation"\*\* - Eliminate manual data processing overhead



\### AI Innovation

\- \*\*"Goes beyond simple data joining"\*\* - AI discovers relationships humans might miss

\- \*\*"Adapts to new data formats"\*\* - Add new systems without reprogramming

\- \*\*"Continuous learning potential"\*\* - Can improve mappings over time

\- \*\*"Enterprise AI deployment"\*\* - Shows understanding of real-world AI applications



\## üéØ Interview Questions \& Answers



\### "How does the AI schema mapping work?"

"The system creates semantic descriptions of each column, converts them to numerical vectors using TF-IDF, then calculates cosine similarity to find the best matches. It's the same principle ChatGPT uses to understand language, but applied to data schema."



\### "Why this approach over manual mapping?"

"Manual mapping doesn't scale - every new data source requires human intervention. This AI approach adapts automatically and can find relationships humans might miss due to different naming conventions."



\### "How would you improve this system?"

"Add real-time data streaming, implement more advanced ML models for predictive quality, integrate computer vision for visual quality inspection, and deploy on cloud infrastructure for enterprise scale."



\### "What's the business ROI?"

"Conservative estimate: if this saves just 1 hour per week for a data analyst (who makes $75k/year), that's $1,800 annual savings. But the real value is in the quality insights - preventing just one major defect recall could save millions."
